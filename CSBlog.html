              This week, I was learning how to loop through react components. I
              ended up learning easier ways in order to deconstruct our list of
              items in order to utilize the across the whole site. I learned how
              to also make our react components a lot more dynamic and that way
              make it a lot easier to edit and move around. I also learned about
              using a .map function in order to loop through my list of items
              and display them. I struggled with the .map function, I wanted to
              just display a certain element from my list of items. I found it
              interesting the way that react itself utilizes this function in
              order to make our website a lot more dynamic, we are able to
              display bunch of lines of code just by using a .map function which
              can be something I could use in order to create an infinite
              website.

                Props: Props initially stand for "Properties". Props are
                arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to
                components via HTML attributes.

            <li>
              <p>
                Destructuring: We may have an array or object that we are
                working with, but we only need some of the items contained in
                these. Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is
                needed.

                Router: A router is used in order to create multiple pages that
                can be accessible withing a website, in this case react imports
                a router that can be used across all websites.

              This week was full of exciting new discoveries and great concepts
              that I will be able to utilize later in the future. The main
              highlight of this week was a very important concept in react:
              Importing and Exporting. This "Exporting and Importing" is the
              ability to reuse any from of data/components created as seprate
              files. This makes your website a lot more dynamic all across your
              code, begin able to simply create components/reusable elements
              like a "footer", "NavBar", "Block", or even "Paragraphs". You want
              to give access to the other files by exporting your file as seen
              on the image to the right where we are exporting "contactContent".
              On our second image we can observe how we are importing
              "contactContent" from our contact page file. Then at the bottom we
              see us using map in order to loop through the information and
              display it. Same applies to the last image, where we Imported
              "navItems" and then utilized them through out our Navbar.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I learned how to Import, Export and utilize the content by using
              props and deconstructing the list like "contactContent". I was
              struggling on how to even give access of my list to the other
              files and make sure that they were in scope in order to utilize
              them in that same file. As of now, I would like to get more
              familiar with the Exporting and Importing process, due to the
              reason that it is pretty new to me, but I am sure that there has
              to be an easier and more simpler way to get this done.

            <li>
              <p>
                Exporting: The export statement makes live bindings from a
                specific file available everywhere else.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Importing: Other files can load the values in these live
                bindings using the import statement.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                CallBack: The useCallBack function returns a memorized function
                that can be utilized. Think of memoization as caching a value so
                that it does not need to be recalculated.
